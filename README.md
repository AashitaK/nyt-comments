# nyt-comments
The package scraps comments posted on New York Times articles and returns the data as pandas dataframes (with an option to store it in ready-to-use csv files) with features engineered to be used as a dataset for data science/machine learning projects. The retrieval of the comments can be customized for a specific timeline or a search query. The package can also be used as an API wrapper for NYT article_search API to perform article search and get the results processed as a ready-to-use pandas dataframe (with an option to store it in csv files).
