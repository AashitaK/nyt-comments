Just like the NYT Community API, the function retrieves all the comments except for the nested replies of depths more than 2 and for each comment/reply, it restricts the number of replies retrieved to 3.

    "Though there is no limit to the number of comments that can be retrieved daily, the article search is restricted to 1000 articles per day. Since the function `get_dataset` uses the NYT article search API inside, the limit for the number of articles applies to it. You must agree to the [Terms of Use](http://developer.nytimes.com/tou) for the NYT API to retrive the articles' data using this package. Sometimes the functions gives `HTTP: 500 Internal Server Error` on account of using NYT API and the solution is to call the function again if it so happens. "
